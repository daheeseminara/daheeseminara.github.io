## Career Objectives

I’m a creative and strategic problem-solver who sees convergence in people and creates win-win solutions. Outside of my diverse experience in financial services, I have passion for planning, connecting with people and creating meaningful experiences – anything from a gig in event planning to team events and networking outings. My absolute favorite was working as a special event planner for an independent movie at Lincoln Center. 

With top CliftonStrengths of Empathy, Developer, WOO, Positivity, and Communication, I am best utilized where I can deploy these strengths to create connections, build trust and plan strategic collaborations in the best interest of my team, clients and company.
